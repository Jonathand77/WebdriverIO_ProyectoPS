Feature: Para Bank Register Feature

  Scenario Outline: As a new customer, I can register into the Para Bank Website
    Given I am on the register page
    When I register with <firstName> and <lastName> and <address> and <city> and <state> and <zipCode> and <phone> and <ssn> and <username> and <password> and <confirmPassword>
    Then I should see a text on the Register result saying <message>

    Examples:
      | firstName | lastName | address  | city     | state     | zipCode | phone | ssn   | username      | password | confirmPassword | message                       |
